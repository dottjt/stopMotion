test.js 

I think it might be a gameplay grid. of 4 x 10
I think I need to figure out how to create a loop of objects into a state.

I need to pop and push items into an array, which will display onto a UI.

so, the array will contain symbols which relate to the different UI elements

var array = [x,o,o,o,p,o,p,p,o]

and the array will constantly pop and push 
pop, shift

best beginning and ending access algorithm

// LEGEND

o - wall, ground. 


IMPORT ! For the next test, you could alternatively have four different arrays for the different heights. That would make more sense, I think.

IMPORT ! Instead of putting into a tile, it might make more sense to create your own tile imo.


test1_5.js

I can't for the life of me get the array to copy itself into another logic array, and simply "trickle" down. I think the setInterval is what may be caulsing it not to work. Maybe it doesn't hvae enough functions? Too many functions perhaps, lol. Possibly.

To what extent do I need to.... maybe it would work better with one array. hmmmm. 



test1_6.js 

Okay, so I've dramatically simplified it, however it needs some work. Taking a break before I go insane. 



test2_1.js 

So... perhaps I need to stop looking at each different phase as works, or from the point of view of states. containing state.


GAME ARRANGEMENT

h1Arrays - contains logic to convey to UI symbols.

h1Arrangement - determines what the h1Array IS.

trickle - changes the h2 and h3 functions.


Problem is that ONCE trickle goes through, it doesn't change again. I THINK because of setTimeout.

OKAY. So it does work, but it just moves so fast, you can't see it.
