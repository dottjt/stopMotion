test.js 

I think it might be a gameplay grid. of 4 x 10
I think I need to figure out how to create a loop of objects into a state.

I need to pop and push items into an array, which will display onto a UI.

so, the array will contain symbols which relate to the different UI elements

var array = [x,o,o,o,p,o,p,p,o]

and the array will constantly pop and push 
pop, shift

best beginning and ending access algorithm

// LEGEND

o - wall, ground. 


IMPORT ! For the next test, you could alternatively have four different arrays for the different heights. That would make more sense, I think.

IMPORT ! Instead of putting into a tile, it might make more sense to create your own tile imo.
